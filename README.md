This project analyzes job descriptions from various industries and job levels (entry, mid, and senior) to extract and categorize key skillsets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The goal is to provide insights into the most in-demand skills across different position levels, industries, and regions by analyzing job listings from an external API.

##Features:
Data Collection: Automated job description retrieval via API integration.
NLP-Based Skill Extraction: Extraction of both hard and soft skills from job descriptions using NLP.
Skillset Categorization: Classification of skills based on job levels and industries.
Interactive Visualizations: Dashboard showcasing skill frequency, industry-specific demands, and trends across job levels.
Trend Analysis: Visualize emerging skills and evolving trends over time.
User Filters: Allow users to explore data based on industry, job level, and region.
Reporting & Export: Ability to export visualizations and insights as PDF or images.

##Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NLTK, SpaCy, Matplotlib, Plotly
Data Source: External API for job descriptions
Visualization Tools: Interactive dashboards powered by Plotly/Dash or Matplotlib

##How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install required Python dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt.
Configure API credentials for job description retrieval.
Run the data collection and analysis scripts to extract and analyze job skillsets.
Use the interactive dashboard to explore insights and export reports.
